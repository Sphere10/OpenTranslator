ASP.net MVC Awesome v. 5.3 Demo

built using VS2015

the nuget packages should restore automatically on first build (Starting with NuGet 2.7, package restore consent is ON by default)
if that doesn't happen go to
Options-> NuGet Package Manager -> General { check Allow Nuget to download missing packages and Automatically check for missing packages }

if you encounter any problems running the demo or using the Awesome Helpers please let us know
